<h2><a name="credits">TortoiseCVS Credits</a></h2>
TortoiseCVS was originally written by <a href="http://www.flourish.org">Francis Irving</a>, heavily based on code by Alexandre
 Parenteau for WinCVS. Thanks to Alexandre for great assistance with the WinCVS
code and getting the project up and running.
<p>
<a href="http://movezig.sourceforge.net/">Ben Campbell</a> offered 
lots of code and help in the early days, as did the folk at <a
href="http://www.creaturelabs.com">Creature Labs</a> who were always
sporting and excited users. Well, they always came over and told me when
things weren't working, anyway.  
<p>
These days, Torsten Martinsen and Martin Crawford mainly run the
project.  Invaluable thanks to them.
<p>
Thanks to the folk who made wxWidgets and, of course!, CVS. Two excellent pieces of software.<br>
<br>
Most of all a round of applause for everyone who has written code and sent a 
patch for TortoiseCVS.  See the <a href="ChangeLog.txt">Change Log</a> for their
names.  Code is the life and blood of open source software. Without your
contributions it would wither.

<p>There's a <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/contributors.shtml">full
list of contributors</a> on the web site.

<p>And much appreciation to everyone who has posted on the TortoiseCVS mailing
list or emailed us with help and support.  <p>

i thank You God for most this amazing
