# TortoiseMenus.config
#
# Config file to specify TortoiseCVS context menus
# (used by 'TortoiseShell.dll').
#
# Each entry must be either
#
#	ITEM
#	   <verb>
#	   <menu text>
#	   <flags>
#	   <helptext>
#	   <icon>
#
# or
#
#	SEPARATOR
#	   <flags>
#
# 
# General flags are:
# 
#	ON_SUB_MENU - Item appears on the CVS-> submenu.  Otherwise "CVS " is added to its name.
#
# Flags to specify whether the menu is present:
#
#	EXACTLY_ONE - There must be only one file/directory selected
#	ALWAYS_HAS - The menu is always present (overrides all other flags)
#
#	ALL_MUST_MATCH_TYPE - By default, at least one selected file must match the TYPE_ flags 
#                             below. Use this to force it to be all files.
#
#	HAS_EDIT - Only shown if "Edit policy" preference specifies that Edit/Unedit is used.
#
#	HAS_EXCL_EDIT - Only shown if "Edit policy" preference specifies "Concurrent or exclusive editing".
#
#
# These correspond to the CVS status of the file
# If several are present, it counts as an "or" between them
#       TYPE_NOT_IN_CVS - In a CVS folder, but not stored in CVS (the blue question mark icon)
#	TYPE_NOWHERE_NEAR_CVS - Not in CVS, not even in a CVS checked out folder (most files)
#	TYPE_ADDED - Added to CVS, but no revision committed yet
#	TYPE_IN_CVS_RW - In CVS, but unchanged
#	TYPE_IN_CVS_RO - In CVS, but unchanged, readonly
#	TYPE_IN_CVS_LOCKED - In CVS, but unchanged, user has edit
#	TYPE_CHANGED - In CVS, modified by the user
#	TYPE_RENAMED - In CVS, renamed by the user
#	TYPE_CONFLICT - In CVS, modified by the user and has a conflict with other users changes
#	TYPE_STATIC - In CVS, marked as 'static', may be modified
#	TYPE_OUTER_DIR - Special for top level directories that contain stuff which is in CVS
#	TYPE_IGNORED - Listed in .cvsignore
#	
# If multiple ones of these are present, then they
# must all be true (along with the status type flags above)
#       TYPE_DIRECTORY - Must be a directory
#	TYPE_FILE - Must be a file
